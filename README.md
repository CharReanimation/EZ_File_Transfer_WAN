# EZ_FILE_TRANSFER

## Intro

This is an easy **File Transfer Web Application** based on *Node*.  
You can transfer FILES between your *Computer(Server)* and your *Phone(Client)*; or even other devices, probably?  
Very easy, so I think that's it for talking about this project intro.  

## Problem Solved

I know, there are a lot of ways to transfer files between devices in the same Network, but I think I'd better just create one for myself.  
Yeah, to find a solution, building one is even faster......  
With this project, you can transfer your FILES between your Computer(Server) and your Phone(Client) in the same Network.

## Build

1: Obviously, you need to have NodeJS installed on your computer.  
2: Clone this project to your computer.  
3: Go to the **Terminal** and run "**npm install**" to install all the dependencies.  
    npm init -y  
    npm install express multer

## Initial Setting

1: Yeah, your *Phone* and *PC* should be in the exact **Same Network (WIFI or LAN)**.  
2: Your Phone should be able to access the Server's IP address (**SEE HOW TO USE**).

## HOW TO USE

1: Make sure you are in this directory: "**ReactJS_EZ_File_Transfer\EZFileTransfer**".  
2: Once you have cloned this project, just make sure you go to the **Terminal** and run "**node ./Server/server.js**".  
3: And it may show something like: "Access URL: <http://192.X.X.X:3000>" (**Or check your console with *ipconfig***).  
4: Use your *Phone & PC Browser* to open the URL, and you will see a page.  
5: Then you can play with FILE transfer between your Phone and PC.  
6: **Kill The Terminal** Then, you can stop the server.

## HOW TO CLEAN UP

1: You will find out a **uploads** folder in your project directory, and all the files you uploaded will be stored in that folder.  
2: Just **Delete** the folder or whatever file you wish to delete, and you are good to go.

## Future Development

1: I am planning to add more features to this project.  
2: Better UI.  
3: Additional Features.  

## Additional Information

1: This project is still in development.  
2: Currently is just a simple file transfer tool (**Very Dummy But Actually Works**).  
3: Don't expect this project to be perfect. I built this for myself and my friends. Why? Because I don't know how to transfer files between my Phone and PC (**I am serious, I don't really know how......**).  
4: I know, this is too dummy, thus I will upgrade this thing to a better version.
